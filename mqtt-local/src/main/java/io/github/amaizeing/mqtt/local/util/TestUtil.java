      "what’s important is that it is in there somewhere so that readers know what the main idea of the paragraph\n" +

      "transition sentence—something that reminds the reader of what happened in the previous paragraph—rather\n" +
      "than with the topic sentence. Let’s suppose that the previous paragraph was about all kinds of animals\n" +

      "(the topic sentence is bold):\n" +

      "Far more piranhas are eaten by people than people are eaten by piranhas.\n" +
      "If the fish are well-fed, they won’t bite humans.\n" +
      "You are probably familiar with the idea that transitions may be needed between paragraphs or\n" +
      "sections in a paper (see our handout on transitions). Sometimes they are also helpful within the body of a single paragraph.\n" +
      "Within a paragraph, transitions are often single words or short phrases that help to establish relationships\n" +
      "between ideas and to create a logical progression of those ideas in a paragraph.\n" +
      "This is especially likely to be true within paragraphs that discuss multiple examples.\n" +
      "Let’s take a look at a version of our piranha paragraph that uses transitions to orient the reader:\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous,\n" +
      "they are, except in two main situations, entirely harmless.\n" +
      "Piranhas rarely feed on large animals; they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants.\n" +
      "When confronted with humans, piranhas’ instinct is to flee, not attack.\n" +
      "But there are two situations in which a piranha bite is likely. The first is when a\n" +
      "frightened piranha is lifted out of the water—for example, if it has been caught in a fishing net.\n" +
      "The second is when the water level in pools where piranhas are living falls too low.\n" +
      "A large number of fish may be trapped in a single pool, and if they are hungry,\n" +
      "they may attack anything that enters the water.\n" +

      "In academic writing, readers expect each paragraph to have a sentence or two that captures its main point.\n" +
      "They’re often called “topic sentences,” though many writing instructors prefer to call them “key sentences.”\n" +
      "There are at least two downsides of the phrase “topic sentence.”\n" +
      "First, it makes it seem like the paramount job of that sentence is simply to announce the topic of the paragraph.\n" +
      "Second, it makes it seem like the topic sentence must always be a single grammatical sentence.\n" +
      "Calling it a “key sentence” reminds us that it expresses the central idea of the paragraph.\n" +
      "And sometimes a question or a two-sentence construction functions as the key.\n" +
      "Both versions convey a topic; it’s pretty easy to predict that the paragraph will be about epidemiological evidence,\n" +
      "but only the second version establishes an argumentative point and puts it in context.\n" +
      "The paragraph doesn’t just describe the epidemiological evidence; it shows how epidemiology is telling the same story\n" +
      "as etiology. Similarly, while Version A doesn’t relate to anything in particular,\n" +
      "Version B immediately suggests that the prior paragraph addresses the biological pathway (i.e. etiology) of a\n" +
      "disease and that the new paragraph will bolster the emerging hypothesis with a different kind of evidence.\n" +
      "As a reader, it’s easy to keep track of how the paragraph about cells and chemicals and such relates to the\n" +
      "paragraph about populations in different places.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "A last thing to note about key sentences is that academic readers expect them to be at the beginning of the paragraph.\n" +
      "(The first sentence this paragraph is a good example of this in action!)\n" +
      "This placement helps readers comprehend your argument. To see how, try this:\n" +
      "find an academic piece (such as a textbook or scholarly article) that strikes you as well written and go\n" +
      "through part of it reading just the first sentence of each paragraph. You should be able to easily follow\n" +
      "the sequence of logic. When you’re writing for professors, it is especially effective to put your key sentences\n" +
      "first because they usually convey your own original thinking. It’s a very good sign when your paragraphs are typically\n" +
      "composed of a telling key sentence followed by evidence and explanation.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Knowing this convention of academic writing can help you both read and write more effectively.\n" +
      "When you’re reading a complicated academic piece for the first time, you might want to go through\n" +
      "reading only the first sentence or two of each paragraph to get the overall outline of the argument.\n" +
      "Then you can go back and read all of it with a clearer picture of how each of the details fit in.\n" +
      "And when you’re writing, you may also find it useful to write the first sentence of each paragraph\n" +
      "(instead of a topic-based outline) to map out a thorough argument before getting immersed in sentence-level wordsmithing.\n" +
      "The first sentence establishes the key idea of balance theory.\n" +
      "The next sentence begins with balance theory and ends with social ties, which is the focus of the third sentence.\n" +
      "The concept of weak ties connects the third and fourth sentences and concept of cliques the fifth and sixth sentences.\n" +
      "In Version A, in contrast, the first sentence focuses on balance theory, but then the second sentence makes a new point\n" +
      "about social ties before telling the reader that the point comes from balance theory. The reader has to take in a lot of\n" +
      "unfamiliar information before learning how it fits in with familiar concepts.\n" +
      "Version A is coherent, but the lack of cohesion makes it tedious to read.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "The lesson is this: if you or others perceive a passage you’ve written to be awkward or choppy,\n" +
      "even though the topic is consistent, try rewriting it to ensure that each sentence begins with a familiar term or concept.\n" +
      "If your points don’t naturally daisy-chain together like the examples given here, consider numbering them.\n" +
      "For example, you may choose to write, “Proponents of the legislation point to four major benefits.”\n" +
      "Then you could discuss four loosely related ideas without leaving your reader wondering how they relate.\n" +
      "Each sentence in the above passage starts with a familiar idea and progresses to a new one, but it lacks\n" +
      "coherence—a sense of being about one thing. Good writers often write passages like that when they’re\n" +
      "free-writing or using the drafting stage to cast a wide net for ideas. A writer weighing the power and\n" +
      "limits of social network analysis may free-write something like that example and, from there, develop a\n" +

      "what’s important is that it is in there somewhere so that readers know what the main idea of the paragraph\n" +

      "transition sentence—something that reminds the reader of what happened in the previous paragraph—rather\n" +
      "than with the topic sentence. Let’s suppose that the previous paragraph was about all kinds of animals\n" +

      "(the topic sentence is bold):\n" +
      "\n" +

      "Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous, they are, for the most part, entirely harmless.\n" +
      "Piranhas rarely feed on large animals; they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants. When confronted with humans,\n" +
      "piranhas’ first instinct is to flee, not attack. Their fear of humans makes sense.\n" +
      "Far more piranhas are eaten by people than people are eaten by piranhas.\n" +
      "If the fish are well-fed, they won’t bite humans.\n" +
      "You are probably familiar with the idea that transitions may be needed between paragraphs or\n" +
      "sections in a paper (see our handout on transitions). Sometimes they are also helpful within the body of a single paragraph.\n" +
      "Within a paragraph, transitions are often single words or short phrases that help to establish relationships\n" +
      "between ideas and to create a logical progression of those ideas in a paragraph.\n" +
      "This is especially likely to be true within paragraphs that discuss multiple examples.\n" +
      "Let’s take a look at a version of our piranha paragraph that uses transitions to orient the reader:\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous,\n" +
      "they are, except in two main situations, entirely harmless.\n" +
      "Piranhas rarely feed on large animals; they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants.\n" +
      "When confronted with humans, piranhas’ instinct is to flee, not attack.\n" +
      "But there are two situations in which a piranha bite is likely. The first is when a\n" +
      "frightened piranha is lifted out of the water—for example, if it has been caught in a fishing net.\n" +
      "The second is when the water level in pools where piranhas are living falls too low.\n" +
      "A large number of fish may be trapped in a single pool, and if they are hungry,\n" +
      "they may attack anything that enters the water.\n" +

      "In academic writing, readers expect each paragraph to have a sentence or two that captures its main point.\n" +
      "They’re often called “topic sentences,” though many writing instructors prefer to call them “key sentences.”\n" +
      "There are at least two downsides of the phrase “topic sentence.”\n" +
      "First, it makes it seem like the paramount job of that sentence is simply to announce the topic of the paragraph.\n" +
      "Second, it makes it seem like the topic sentence must always be a single grammatical sentence.\n" +
      "Calling it a “key sentence” reminds us that it expresses the central idea of the paragraph.\n" +
      "And sometimes a question or a two-sentence construction functions as the key.\n" +
      "Both versions convey a topic; it’s pretty easy to predict that the paragraph will be about epidemiological evidence,\n" +
      "but only the second version establishes an argumentative point and puts it in context.\n" +
      "The paragraph doesn’t just describe the epidemiological evidence; it shows how epidemiology is telling the same story\n" +
      "as etiology. Similarly, while Version A doesn’t relate to anything in particular,\n" +
      "Version B immediately suggests that the prior paragraph addresses the biological pathway (i.e. etiology) of a\n" +
      "disease and that the new paragraph will bolster the emerging hypothesis with a different kind of evidence.\n" +
      "As a reader, it’s easy to keep track of how the paragraph about cells and chemicals and such relates to the\n" +
      "paragraph about populations in different places.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "A last thing to note about key sentences is that academic readers expect them to be at the beginning of the paragraph.\n" +
      "(The first sentence this paragraph is a good example of this in action!)\n" +
      "This placement helps readers comprehend your argument. To see how, try this:\n" +
      "find an academic piece (such as a textbook or scholarly article) that strikes you as well written and go\n" +
      "through part of it reading just the first sentence of each paragraph. You should be able to easily follow\n" +
      "the sequence of logic. When you’re writing for professors, it is especially effective to put your key sentences\n" +
      "first because they usually convey your own original thinking. It’s a very good sign when your paragraphs are typically\n" +
      "composed of a telling key sentence followed by evidence and explanation.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Knowing this convention of academic writing can help you both read and write more effectively.\n" +
      "When you’re reading a complicated academic piece for the first time, you might want to go through\n" +
      "reading only the first sentence or two of each paragraph to get the overall outline of the argument.\n" +
      "Then you can go back and read all of it with a clearer picture of how each of the details fit in.\n" +
      "And when you’re writing, you may also find it useful to write the first sentence of each paragraph\n" +
      "(instead of a topic-based outline) to map out a thorough argument before getting immersed in sentence-level wordsmithing.\n" +
      "The first sentence establishes the key idea of balance theory.\n" +
      "The next sentence begins with balance theory and ends with social ties, which is the focus of the third sentence.\n" +
      "The concept of weak ties connects the third and fourth sentences and concept of cliques the fifth and sixth sentences.\n" +
      "In Version A, in contrast, the first sentence focuses on balance theory, but then the second sentence makes a new point\n" +
      "about social ties before telling the reader that the point comes from balance theory. The reader has to take in a lot of\n" +
      "unfamiliar information before learning how it fits in with familiar concepts.\n" +
      "Version A is coherent, but the lack of cohesion makes it tedious to read.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "The lesson is this: if you or others perceive a passage you’ve written to be awkward or choppy,\n" +
      "even though the topic is consistent, try rewriting it to ensure that each sentence begins with a familiar term or concept.\n" +
      "If your points don’t naturally daisy-chain together like the examples given here, consider numbering them.\n" +
      "For example, you may choose to write, “Proponents of the legislation point to four major benefits.”\n" +
      "Then you could discuss four loosely related ideas without leaving your reader wondering how they relate.\n" +
      "Each sentence in the above passage starts with a familiar idea and progresses to a new one, but it lacks\n" +
      "coherence—a sense of being about one thing. Good writers often write passages like that when they’re\n" +
      "free-writing or using the drafting stage to cast a wide net for ideas. A writer weighing the power and\n" +
      "limits of social network analysis may free-write something like that example and, from there, develop a\n" +
      "more specific plan for summarizing key insights about social networks and then discussing them with\n" +
      "reference to the core tenets of social science. As a draft, an incoherent paragraph often points to a\n" +
      "productive line of reasoning; one just has to continue thinking it through in order to identify a clear\n" +
      "argumentative purpose for each paragraph. With its purpose defined, each paragraph, then, becomes a lot\n" +
      "easier to write. Coherent paragraphs aren’t just about style; they are a sign of a thoughtful, well developed analysis.\n" +
      "Some guides advise you to end each paragraph with a specific concluding sentence, in a sense, to treat each paragraph\n" +
      "as a kind of mini-essay. But that’s not a widely held convention. Most well written academic pieces don’t adhere to\n" +
      "that structure. The last sentence of the paragraph should certainly be in your own words (as in, not a quote),\n" +
      "but as long as the paragraph succeeds in carrying out the task that it has been assigned by its key sentence,\n" +
      "you don’t need to worry about whether that last sentence has an air of conclusiveness. For example, consider\n" +
      "these paragraphs about the cold fusion controversy of the 1980s that appeared in a best-selling textbook.\n" +
      "To reiterate the initial point, it is useful to think of paragraphs as punctuation that organize your ideas in a\n" +
      "readable way. Each paragraph should be an irreplaceable node within a coherent sequence of logic.\n" +
      "Thinking of paragraphs as “building blocks” evokes the “five-paragraph theme” structure explained earlier:\n" +
      "if you have identical stone blocks, it hardly matters what order they’re in. In the successful organically\n" +
      "structured college paper, the structure and tone of each paragraph reflects its indispensable role within\n" +
      "the overall piece. Make every bit count and have each part situated within the whole.";

      "You are probably familiar with the idea that transitions may be needed between paragraphs or\n" +
      "sections in a paper (see our handout on transitions). Sometimes they are also helpful within the body of a single paragraph.\n" +
      "Within a paragraph, transitions are often single words or short phrases that help to establish relationships\n" +
      "between ideas and to create a logical progression of those ideas in a paragraph.\n" +
      "This is especially likely to be true within paragraphs that discuss multiple examples.\n" +
      "Let’s take a look at a version of our piranha paragraph that uses transitions to orient the reader:\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous,\n" +
      "they are, except in two main situations, entirely harmless.\n" +
      "Piranhas rarely feed on large animals; they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants.\n" +
      "When confronted with humans, piranhas’ instinct is to flee, not attack.\n" +
      "But there are two situations in which a piranha bite is likely. The first is when a\n" +
      "frightened piranha is lifted out of the water—for example, if it has been caught in a fishing net.\n" +
      "The second is when the water level in pools where piranhas are living falls too low.\n" +
      "A large number of fish may be trapped in a single pool, and if they are hungry,\n" +
      "they may attack anything that enters the water.\n" +

      "sections in a paper (see our handout on transitions). Sometimes they are also helpful within the body of a single paragraph.\n" +
      "Within a paragraph, transitions are often single words or short phrases that help to establish relationships\n" +
      "between ideas and to create a logical progression of those ideas in a paragraph.\n" +
      "This is especially likely to be true within paragraphs that discuss multiple examples.\n" +

      "Although most people consider piranhas to be quite dangerous,\n" +

      "When confronted with humans, piranhas’ instinct is to flee, not attack.\n" +
      "But there are two situations in which a piranha bite is likely. The first is when a\n" +
      "frightened piranha is lifted out of the water—for example, if it has been caught in a fishing net.\n" +
      "The second is when the water level in pools where piranhas are living falls too low.\n" +
      "A large number of fish may be trapped in a single pool, and if they are hungry,\n" +
      "they may attack anything that enters the water.\n" +

      "They’re often called “topic sentences,” though many writing instructors prefer to call them “key sentences.”\n" +
      "There are at least two downsides of the phrase “topic sentence.”\n" +
      "First, it makes it seem like the paramount job of that sentence is simply to announce the topic of the paragraph.\n" +
      "Second, it makes it seem like the topic sentence must always be a single grammatical sentence.\n" +
      "Calling it a “key sentence” reminds us that it expresses the central idea of the paragraph.\n" +

      "Both versions convey a topic; it’s pretty easy to predict that the paragraph will be about epidemiological evidence,\n" +

      "The paragraph doesn’t just describe the epidemiological evidence; it shows how epidemiology is telling the same story\n" +
      "as etiology. Similarly, while Version A doesn’t relate to anything in particular,\n" +
      "Version B immediately suggests that the prior paragraph addresses the biological pathway (i.e. etiology) of a\n" +
      "disease and that the new paragraph will bolster the emerging hypothesis with a different kind of evidence.\n" +
      "As a reader, it’s easy to keep track of how the paragraph about cells and chemicals and such relates to the\n" +

      "\n" +
      "A last thing to note about key sentences is that academic readers expect them to be at the beginning of the paragraph.\n" +

      "\n" +
      "Knowing this convention of academic writing can help you both read and write more effectively.\n" +
      "When you’re reading a complicated academic piece for the first time, you might want to go through\n" +
      "reading only the first sentence or two of each paragraph to get the overall outline of the argument.\n" +
      "Then you can go back and read all of it with a clearer picture of how each of the details fit in.\n" +
      "And when you’re writing, you may also find it useful to write the first sentence of each paragraph\n" +

      "The concept of weak ties connects the third and fourth sentences and concept of cliques the fifth and sixth sentences.\n" +
      "In Version A, in contrast, the first sentence focuses on balance theory, but then the second sentence makes a new point\n" +
      "about social ties before telling the reader that the point comes from balance theory. The reader has to take in a lot of\n" +
      "unfamiliar information before learning how it fits in with familiar concepts.\n" +

      "more specific plan for summarizing key insights about social networks and then discussing them with\n" +
      "reference to the core tenets of social science. As a draft, an incoherent paragraph often points to a\n" +
      "productive line of reasoning; one just has to continue thinking it through in order to identify a clear\n" +
      "argumentative purpose for each paragraph. With its purpose defined, each paragraph, then, becomes a lot\n" +
      "easier to write. Coherent paragraphs aren’t just about style; they are a sign of a thoughtful, well developed analysis.\n" +
      "Some guides advise you to end each paragraph with a specific concluding sentence, in a sense, to treat each paragraph\n" +
      "as a kind of mini-essay. But that’s not a widely held convention. Most well written academic pieces don’t adhere to\n" +

      "Piranhas rarely feed on large animals; they eat smaller fish and aquatic plants.\n" +

      "The second is when the water level in pools where piranhas are living falls too low.\n" +

      "In academic writing, readers expect each paragraph to have a sentence or two that captures its main point.\n" +
      "They’re often called “topic sentences,” though many writing instructors prefer to call them “key sentences.”\n" +
      "There are at least two downsides of the phrase “topic sentence.”\n" +
      "First, it makes it seem like the paramount job of that sentence is simply to announce the topic of the paragraph.\n" +
      "Second, it makes it seem like the topic sentence must always be a single grammatical sentence.\n" +
      "Calling it a “key sentence” reminds us that it expresses the central idea of the paragraph.\n" +
      "And sometimes a question or a two-sentence construction functions as the key.\n" +
      "Both versions convey a topic; it’s pretty easy to predict that the paragraph will be about epidemiological evidence,\n" +
      "but only the second version establishes an argumentative point and puts it in context.\n" +
      "The paragraph doesn’t just describe the epidemiological evidence; it shows how epidemiology is telling the same story\n" +
      "as etiology. Similarly, while Version A doesn’t relate to anything in particular,\n" +
      "Version B immediately suggests that the prior paragraph addresses the biological pathway (i.e. etiology) of a\n" +
      "disease and that the new paragraph will bolster the emerging hypothesis with a different kind of evidence.\n" +
      "As a reader, it’s easy to keep track of how the paragraph about cells and chemicals and such relates to the\n" +
      "paragraph about populations in different places.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "A last thing to note about key sentences is that academic readers expect them to be at the beginning of the paragraph.\n" +
      "(The first sentence this paragraph is a good example of this in action!)\n" +
      "This placement helps readers comprehend your argument. To see how, try this:\n" +
      "find an academic piece (such as a textbook or scholarly article) that strikes you as well written and go\n" +
      "through part of it reading just the first sentence of each paragraph. You should be able to easily follow\n" +
      "the sequence of logic. When you’re writing for professors, it is especially effective to put your key sentences\n" +
      "first because they usually convey your own original thinking. It’s a very good sign when your paragraphs are typically\n" +
      "composed of a telling key sentence followed by evidence and explanation.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "Knowing this convention of academic writing can help you both read and write more effectively.\n" +
      "When you’re reading a complicated academic piece for the first time, you might want to go through\n" +
      "reading only the first sentence or two of each paragraph to get the overall outline of the argument.\n" +
      "Then you can go back and read all of it with a clearer picture of how each of the details fit in.\n" +
      "And when you’re writing, you may also find it useful to write the first sentence of each paragraph\n" +
      "(instead of a topic-based outline) to map out a thorough argument before getting immersed in sentence-level wordsmithing.\n" +
      "The first sentence establishes the key idea of balance theory.\n" +
      "The next sentence begins with balance theory and ends with social ties, which is the focus of the third sentence.\n" +
      "The concept of weak ties connects the third and fourth sentences and concept of cliques the fifth and sixth sentences.\n" +
      "In Version A, in contrast, the first sentence focuses on balance theory, but then the second sentence makes a new point\n" +
      "about social ties before telling the reader that the point comes from balance theory. The reader has to take in a lot of\n" +
      "unfamiliar information before learning how it fits in with familiar concepts.\n" +
      "Version A is coherent, but the lack of cohesion makes it tedious to read.\n" +
      "\n" +
      "The lesson is this: if you or others perceive a passage you’ve written to be awkward or choppy,\n" +
      "even though the topic is consistent, try rewriting it to ensure that each sentence begins with a familiar term or concept.\n" +
      "If your points don’t naturally daisy-chain together like the examples given here, consider numbering them.\n" +
      "For example, you may choose to write, “Proponents of the legislation point to four major benefits.”\n" +
      "Then you could discuss four loosely related ideas without leaving your reader wondering how they relate.\n" +
      "Each sentence in the above passage starts with a familiar idea and progresses to a new one, but it lacks\n" +
      "coherence—a sense of being about one thing. Good writers often write passages like that when they’re\n" +
      "free-writing or using the drafting stage to cast a wide net for ideas. A writer weighing the power and\n" +
      "limits of social network analysis may free-write something like that example and, from there, develop a\n" +
      "more specific plan for summarizing key insights about social networks and then discussing them with\n" +
      "reference to the core tenets of social science. As a draft, an incoherent paragraph often points to a\n" +
      "productive line of reasoning; one just has to continue thinking it through in order to identify a clear\n" +
      "argumentative purpose for each paragraph. With its purpose defined, each paragraph, then, becomes a lot\n" +
      "easier to write. Coherent paragraphs aren’t just about style; they are a sign of a thoughtful, well developed analysis.\n" +
      "Some guides advise you to end each paragraph with a specific concluding sentence, in a sense, to treat each paragraph\n" +
      "as a kind of mini-essay. But that’s not a widely held convention. Most well written academic pieces don’t adhere to\n" +
      "that structure. The last sentence of the paragraph should certainly be in your own words (as in, not a quote),\n" +
      "but as long as the paragraph succeeds in carrying out the task that it has been assigned by its key sentence,\n" +
      "you don’t need to worry about whether that last sentence has an air of conclusiveness. For example, consider\n" +
      "these paragraphs about the cold fusion controversy of the 1980s that appeared in a best-selling textbook.\n" +
      "To reiterate the initial point, it is useful to think of paragraphs as punctuation that organize your ideas in a\n" +
      "readable way. Each paragraph should be an irreplaceable node within a coherent sequence of logic.\n" +
      "Thinking of paragraphs as “building blocks” evokes the “five-paragraph theme” structure explained earlier:\n" +
      "if you have identical stone blocks, it hardly matters what order they’re in. In the successful organically\n" +
      "structured college paper, the structure and tone of each paragraph reflects its indispensable role within\n" +
      "the overall piece. Make every bit count and have each part situated within the whole.\n" +
